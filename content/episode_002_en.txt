Script (narration):

The Qur’an warns us about Jahannam with clarity and purpose. In Surah Al‑Hijr, Allah says about Hell: “It has seven gates; for every gate is of them a portion designated.” Each gate is justice—no soul is wronged.

Jahannam is not a story to scare, but a reality to prepare for. On the Day of Judgment, groups will be led—some to punishment and some to mercy. Allah will even say to Hell, “Are you full?” and it will reply, “Are there any more?” The scene is heavy, and it’s meant to wake our hearts.

What protects us? Faith that is lived, not just said. Prayer on time. Charity that softens the heart. Truth on the tongue. Patience in hardship. And repentance—returning to Allah again and again. No one who turns back to Allah loses by it.

Today, choose one step: pray your next prayer with focus, forgive someone, or give in charity for Allah’s sake. Ask Allah to keep you far from the gates of Jahannam and near to the gates of Jannah.

O Allah, save us from the Fire and make us steadfast upon truth and patience. Ameen.
