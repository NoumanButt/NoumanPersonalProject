Title: Surah Al-Asr — The Value of Time

Surah al-Asr is a timeless reminder. Allah swears by time, and then tells us a hard truth: most people are in loss—except those who do four things. They believe in Allah, they do righteous actions, they encourage each other to stay upon the truth, and they encourage each other to be patient.

In just three short verses, Allah gives a roadmap for success: faith, action, truth, and patience. Today, choose one step: pray with focus, help someone in need, speak the truth kindly, or stay patient in a test.

May Allah make us among those who are not in loss. This is a simple reminder based on Surah al-Asr in the Qur’an, chapter 103.
